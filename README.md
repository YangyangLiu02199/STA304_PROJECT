# Logistic Regression and Propensity Score Analysis on Paycheck Protection Program
The project focuses on the payback protection program in US and studies how the
demographic features of applicants would affect the result of getting big loan, which is
valued more than 5 million, or small loan, which is valued from $150,000 to 5 million. In
order to study this, logistic regression is used to examine correlations between loan type
and various factors, such as the state the applicant belongs, the gender and the race
of the applicant. Also, propensity score is used to analyze if the non-profit company
would lead a better chance for a big loan.
